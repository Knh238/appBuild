Search all books by on the icon in the righthand corner.
-You can search through the books by title, author, ibsn, or book key
-select your search type from the dropdown menu and enter the search info
-this will direct you to an individual book page view of the requested text or an error message if not found

Also pardon any messiness as I was doing this in 6ish hours. If I had more time, I'd have added tests and moved more to the redux store.
